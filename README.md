# How I Passed the (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity Exam

> TL;DR – 10 days of test-first learning, 100 % free resources, 1 attempt.

## My Study Principles
1. **Active recall beats passive reading.** Timed quizzes first as a baseline; theory only for wrong answers.
2. **Small, daily reps.** First practice exam, break, second practice exam, then closing with ~30 minutes of reviewing mistakes.
3. **Solo, but structured.** No study groups but disciplined self-testing and note-taking.
